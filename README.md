## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-activitylog
```

The package will automatically register itself.

You can publish the migration with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Russofinn\Interactions\InteractionsServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

*Note*: The default migration assumes you are using integers for your model IDs. If you are using UUIDs, or some other format, adjust the format of the subject_id and causer_id fields in the published migration before continuing.

After publishing the migration you can create the `activity_log` table by running the migrations:


```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can optionally publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Russofinn\Interactions\InteractionsServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * If set to false, no activities will be saved to the database.
     */
    'enabled' => env('ACTIVITY_LOGGER_ENABLED', true),

    /*
     * When the clean-command is executed, all recording activities older than
     * the number of days specified here will be deleted.
     */
    'delete_records_older_than_days' => 365,

    /*
     * If no log name is passed to the activity() helper
     * we use this default log name.
     */
    'default_log_name' => 'default',

    /*
     * You can specify an auth driver here that gets user models.
     * If this is null we'll use the default Laravel auth driver.
     */
    'default_auth_driver' => null,

    /*
     * If set to true, the subject returns soft deleted models.
     */
    'subject_returns_soft_deleted_models' => false,

    /*
     * This model will be used to log activity. The only requirement is that
     * it should be or extend the Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity model.
     */
    'activity_model' => \Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity::class,
    
    /*
     * This is the name of the table that will be created by the migration and
     * used by the Activity model shipped with this package.
     */
    'table_name' => 'activity_log',
];

```
